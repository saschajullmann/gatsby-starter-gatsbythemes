# gatsby-starter-gatsbythemes

This is a basic starter package for
[GatsbyJS](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby). I found myself doing the same
things over and over again when starting a new gatsby project, hence I figured
I should created myself a starter so that I don't have to start from scratch
every single time. Maybe this starter can be useful to some of you.

## Demo
A preview of the starter can be seen [here](https://themes.gatsbythemes.com/gatsby-starter/).

## What's included

Currently this starter includes the following:

* FINALLY with gatsby V2.
* CSS-in-JS via [Emotion](https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion).
* Jest and react-test-renderer for testing (configured according to [click](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/unit-testing/)).
* Eslint in dev mode with the airbnb config and prettier formatting rules.
* A basic blog, with posts under src/pages/blog. There's also a script which creates a new Blog entry (post.sh).
* Data per JSON files.
* A few basic components (Navigation, Footer, Layout).
* Layout components make use of [Styled-System](https://github.com/jxnblk/styled-system).
* Google Analytics (you just have to enter your tracking-id).
* [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for a uniform codebase.
* [Normalize](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) css (8.0).
* [Feather](https://feather.netlify.com/) icons.
* Font styles taken from [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/).


## How to use it?

If you have 'gatsby' installed globally, just start a new project with:

```
gatsby new my-project https://github.com/saschajullmann/gatsby-starter-gatsbythemes
```

If there is anything else you'd like to see included or changed, just let me
know.
